The Lowdown:

- COLUMBITS.h: Contains core drawing primitives and bitmap manipulation algorithms; A collection of device-independent intermediate functions. Requires either a custom front and backend implementation, or one of the header files included in order to successfully display a window. 

- COLUMBITS_VECTOR.h: Contains higher-level geometric algorithms and rasterization methods. 

- COLUMBITS_IMAGE.h: Contains image format parsing for .png files.

- COLUMBITS_3D.h: Contains higher-level 3-dimensional geometric algorithms and rasterization methods.

- COLUMBITS_PHYSICS.h: Contains higher-level physics functions, more accurate geometric algorithms, implements time-based algorithms.

- COLUMBITS_AUDIO.h: Contains audio format parsing for .mp3, .wav files.

- COLUMBITS_GUI.h: Contains higher-level access to "widgets" that connect to device-agnostic events and display text, live on widget bars. 

- COLUMBITS_APP.h: Contains functions for creating dynamic applications with "widgets" and bitmaps.
